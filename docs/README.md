## Documentation Standards

All documentation in this repository follows these principles:

- **Clear and concise** - Focus on essential information
- **Up-to-date** - Update docs when code changes
- **Searchable** - Use consistent terminology
- **Actionable** - Include concrete examples and commands
- **Version controlled** - Track changes via git

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating documentation:

1. **Place files in the appropriate section** - Use the structure above
2. **Update navigation** - Add links to relevant README files
3. **Follow markdown best practices** - Use headers, lists, code blocks
4. **Include examples** - Show, don't just tell
5. **Keep it current** - Review and update regularly

## PRD Workflow

Product requirements follow this workflow:

1. Create PRD using `/prd-create` command in `docs/prd/features/`
2. Review and refine PRD with stakeholders
3. Create Linear issues using `/issues-create`
4. Implement features following TDD approach
5. Update documentation as features are completed

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Significant architectural decisions are documented in `architecture/decisions/` using this format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Status**: Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [Names]

## Context
What is the issue we're facing?

## Decision
What did we decide to do?

## Consequences
What are the implications of this decision?
```
