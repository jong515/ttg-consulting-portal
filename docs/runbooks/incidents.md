**User Reports**: TBD (support email, chat, etc.)

### 2. Triage

**Steps**:

4. Create incident channel/ticket

### 3. Investigation

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Check recent deployments
- [ ] Review database performance
- [ ] Check external service status

### 4. Communication

**Internal**:
- Update incident channel regularly
- Keep stakeholders informed

**External**:
- Update status page
- Notify affected users (if needed)

### 5. Resolution

**Steps**:
1. Identify root cause
2. Implement fix or workaround
3. Test fix thoroughly
4. Deploy fix
5. Verify resolution

### 6. Post-Incident

**Required**:
- Write incident report
- Conduct blameless postmortem
- Create action items to prevent recurrence
- Update runbooks

## Common Incidents & Solutions

### Application Down

**Symptoms**: Application not responding, 5xx errors

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check application status
# TBD

# Check logs
# TBD

# Check resource usage
# TBD
```

**Common Causes**:
- Deployment issue
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory)
- Database connection issues

**Resolution**:
1. Check deployment status
2. Rollback if recent deployment
3. Restart application if needed
4. Scale resources if needed

---

### Database Issues

**Symptoms**: Slow queries, connection errors, timeouts

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check database connections
# TBD

# Check slow queries
# TBD

# Check database size
# TBD
```

**Common Causes**:
- Too many connections
- Slow queries
- Disk space full
- Locks/deadlocks

**Resolution**:
1. Kill long-running queries
2. Add indexes if needed
3. Increase connection pool
4. Scale database resources

---

### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms**: Slow page loads, high response times

**Diagnosis**:
- Check monitoring dashboards
- Review APM traces
- Check database query performance
- Check external API response times

**Common Causes**:
- N+1 queries
- Missing indexes
- Large payloads
- External service slowdown

**Resolution**:
1. Optimize slow queries
2. Add caching
3. Implement pagination
4. Scale infrastructure

---

### Authentication Issues

**Symptoms**: Users unable to log in, 401 errors on all protected endpoints

**Diagnosis**:
- Check application logs for `"Failed to fetch JWKS"` (JWKS endpoint unreachable)
- Check for `"Unexpected error during authentication"` (catch-all triggered — investigate root cause)
- Check for `"Token missing required 'sub' claim"` in 401 responses (Clerk JWT template may need `sub`)
- Verify `CLERK_JWKS_URL` and `CLERK_ISSUER` environment variables are set and correct
- Verify Clerk dashboard status (https://status.clerk.com)

**Common Causes**:
- `CLERK_JWKS_URL` or `CLERK_ISSUER` misconfigured or unset
- Clerk JWKS endpoint down or unreachable (10s timeout will fire)
- JWKS cache expired and refresh failed — all new requests fail until Clerk recovers
- `CLERK_AUDIENCE` mismatch in staging/production (token's `aud` doesn't match configured value)
- Clerk JWT template missing `sub` claim (custom templates override defaults)

**Resolution**:
1. Verify `CLERK_JWKS_URL`, `CLERK_ISSUER`, and `CLERK_AUDIENCE` environment variables
2. Check Clerk service status
3. If JWKS fetch is timing out, check network connectivity from the backend host to Clerk
4. If `CLERK_AUDIENCE` was recently changed, redeploy with the updated value
5. Application restart clears the JWKS cache, forcing a fresh fetch

---

### External Service Outage

**Symptoms**: Features dependent on external APIs failing

**Diagnosis**:
- Check external service status pages
- Review API error logs

**Resolution**:
1. Implement graceful degradation
2. Show user-friendly error messages
3. Retry with exponential backoff
4. Monitor for service recovery

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Application Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
# TBD
```

**Steps**:
1. Identify last known good version
2. Trigger rollback deployment
3. Verify application health
4. Monitor for issues

### Database Rollback

**WARNING**: Database rollbacks can cause data loss

**Steps**:
1. Stop application writes
2. Run rollback migration
3. Verify data integrity
4. Restart application
